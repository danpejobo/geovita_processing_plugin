# Geovita Processing Provider

A QGIS plugin for different Geovita custom processing algorithms. This plugin is currently under development, so new features may be expected!

**New algorithms are added to this repo as they are developed, and new releases published!**

## Results from the REMEDY GIS RiskTool
The following images show some example results. Both the excavation and the tunnel algorithm produces results for short and/or longterm settlements, but uses different calculation methods. The impact map calculates and illustrate total settlements in the impaced soil around the excavation.

| Loaded Layers | Short term | Long term | Impact map |
