description=This plugin adds different Geovita custom processing algorithms to QGIS
version=1.0.2
author=DPE
email=dpe@geovita.no

about=Geovita plugin provider. This plugin enables different processing algorithms and is under development.

	Now it implements NGI's REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool to QGIS:
	* Begrens Skade - Excavation: The Begrens Skade - Excavation algorithm provides a comprehensive analysis of building settlements and risks associated with subsidence and inclination.
	* Begrens Skade - ImpactMap: The BegrensSkade ImpactMap alorithm calculates both short-term and long-term settlements that occur due to the establishment of a construction pit (this alg. takes a bit of time to run, open the log and refresh it to see the logged progress).
	* Begrens Skade - Tunnel: The BegrensSkade Tunnel alorithm provides a comprehensive analysis of building settlements and risks associated with subsidence and inclination due to tunnel excavation.
