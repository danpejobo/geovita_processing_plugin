about=Geovita plugin provider. This plugin enables different geological and geotechnical algorithms to QGIS, and is under development.

	Now it implements NGI's REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool to QGIS:

	* REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool is an open-source GIS-based tool using the GIBV method to quantify building damage risks from deep excavation, analyzing settlements due to wall deformation and groundwater drawdown, developed under the REMEDY/Begrens Skade 2 research project (2017â€“2022).

	* Begrens Skade - Excavation: Analyzes building settlement risks in soft clays caused by deep excavation wall deformation, using the GIBV method to calculate vertical greenfield settlements based on empirical data from retaining wall behavior (developed under the REMEDY/Begrens Skade 2 project).
	* Begrens Skade - ImpactMap: Quantifies short- and long-term consolidation settlements from groundwater drawdown during construction pit establishment, employing the GIBV method and empirical datasets to model spatiotemporal risk distribution in soft clays (part of the NFR-funded REMEDY initiative).
	* Begrens Skade - Tunnel: Evaluates subsidence and inclination risks in buildings adjacent to tunnel excavations, leveraging the GIBV framework to predict settlements induced by tunneling activities in soft clay environments (developed through the REMEDY/Begrens Skade 2 research collaboration).

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=v.3.2.0 (13.03.2025)
	- Uppdate submodule to newest upstream.
	- Rewrite logic for adding and styling layers. Now uses postProcessing. Results should be added to TOC, and visible on the canvas

	v.3.1.1 (04.03.2024)
	- Add version logging and feedback.
	- Fix for two layers having the same name in the excavation algorithm (thus only one showing in TOC)
	- Fix "label" attributes for the styles to the excavation and tunnel algorithms

	v.3.1.0 (14.02.2024)
	- Minor fix in vulnerability analysis for excavation and tunnel. Fields can be omitted (i.e corresponding analysis are dropped). Any combination of the three vulnerability fields can be assessed.

	v.3.0.0 (09.02.2024)
	- Restructure codebase
	- Implement postprocessing to add layers (was still some threading issues)
	- Add tests to try and mitigate the risk of publishing a broken plugin
	- fix path issue in impactmap (no raster or invalid path)
	- fix error in how coordinate system for impactmap is set in the main REMEDY repo

	v.2.0.2 (01.02.2024)
	- Fix unbound local reference to DTB-raster
	- Fix bug with checking version. Undefined variable if version < 33200

	v.2.0.0 (29.01.2024)
	- Add reproject functionality
	- Fix: Access violation error due to maipulating GUI from process thread
	- Fix: Group/layers in TOC updates correctly
	- Fixed impact map clip distance
	- Fixed impact map resample
	- Minor bugs in all modules
	
	v.1.0.2 (24.01.2024)
	- Update a bug in the utility function get_shapefile_as_json_pyqgis, where excavations containing Z/M-dimentions (they are dropped) did not process correctly, resulting in an bug in the underlying submodule.

	v.1.0.1 (17.01.2024)
	- Initial "release" of the QGIS implementation of NGI's REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool
