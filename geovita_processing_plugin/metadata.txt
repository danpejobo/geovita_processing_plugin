description=This plugin adds different Geovita custom processing algorithms to QGIS
version=3.1.1
author=DPE
email=dpe@geovita.no

about=Geovita plugin provider. This plugin enables different processing algorithms and is under development.

	Now it implements NGI's REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool to QGIS:
	* Begrens Skade - Excavation: The Begrens Skade - Excavation algorithm provides a comprehensive analysis of building settlements and risks associated with subsidence and inclination.
	* Begrens Skade - ImpactMap: The BegrensSkade ImpactMap alorithm calculates both short-term and long-term settlements that occur due to the establishment of a construction pit (this alg. takes a bit of time to run, open the log and refresh it to see the logged progress).
	* Begrens Skade - Tunnel: The BegrensSkade Tunnel alorithm provides a comprehensive analysis of building settlements and risks associated with subsidence and inclination due to tunnel excavation.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=v.3.1.1 (04.03.2024)
	- Add version logging and feedback.
	- Fix for two layers having the same name in the excavation algorithm (thus only one showing in TOC)
	- Fix the "label" attribute for styles to the excavation and tunnel algorithms

	v.3.1.0 (14.02.2024)
	- Minor fix in vulnerability analysis for excavation and tunnel. Fields can be omitted (i.e corresponding analysis are dropped). Any combination of the three vulnerability fields can be assessed.

	v.3.0.0 (09.02.2024)
	- Restructure codebase
	- Implement postprocessing to add layers (was still some threading issues)
	- Add tests to try and mitigate the risk of publishing a broken plugin
	- fix path issue in impactmap (no raster or invalid path)
	- fix error in how coordinate system for impactmap is set in the main REMEDY repo

	v.2.0.2 (01.02.2024)
	- Fix unbound local reference to DTB-raster
	- Fix bug with checking version. Undefined variable if version < 33200

	v.2.0.0 (29.01.2024)
	- Add reproject functionality
	- Fix: Access violation error due to maipulating GUI from process thread
	- Fix: Group/layers in TOC updates correctly
	- Fixed impact map clip distance
	- Fixed impact map resample
	- Minor bugs in all modules
	
	v.1.0.2 (24.01.2024)
	- Update a bug in the utility function get_shapefile_as_json_pyqgis, where excavations containing Z/M-dimentions (they are dropped) did not process correctly, resulting in an bug in the underlying submodule.

	v.1.0.1 (17.01.2024)
	- Initial "release" of the QGIS implementation of NGI's REMEDY_GIS_RiskTool
